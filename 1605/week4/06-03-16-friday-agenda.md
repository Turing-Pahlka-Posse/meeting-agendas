+## Notes
 +
 +### What did we learn and what would you like to see happen moving forward?
 +
 +Sonia: This was useful in the context of finishing http, neat to see the api in action, and the triangulation, moving forward would like to see us focus on mobile app.
 +
 +Marina: Cool to see it in action, looking forward to more work time and being a part of this
 +Yoseph: seeing the backend of a website, we just finished http and it was cool to see rails. Would like to see the front end developed more. 
 +
 +Kerry: The 30 cases started to sink in, how the maps work. Moving forward, have an idea regarding the layers. Moving forward, lets get rental price information and figure out how to incorporate. In terms of perfecting, it is not intuitive what the three addresses mean. People don't get what that means, need to communicate that to the user.
 +
 +David: seeing the map and styling was cool, would like to get a better understanding of all the pieces and how they interact.
 +
 +July: Learned that you need to change settings to use your microphone in making a screencast. :) Felt weird to be doing a screencast, got some good practice. Moving forward wants to see someone else pick up the mapping. Happy Thom and Kerry expressed interest. We should have a thorough readme, context of where we are coming from and where we want to go. Even before publishing the video. So people can jump in and understand what is going on.
 +
 +Nick: learned to make screencast. Good to go through the code, went through some things, could identify improvements, but happy it works. Able to refresh understanding of the code. When you click on the address, we could have a popup that asks you to enter the three addresses that are most important.
 +
 +Tommasina: Neat to learn more about API keys, calling APIs. Would like to see surveying people who actually use the app, understand their needs. Perhaps lets support Spanish.
 +
 +Thom: learned about mapping and jquery. moving forward, the affordability part is something we haven't hit yet. would like to see code we have perfected. it is a bit fragile (if you don't put in all 3 addresses it breaks). we need to be able, when you hover over a neighborhood, there is a popup of the name so we can identify what they are. Need to return "address not valid" and which one is not valid, please try again.
